       wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory
       for better NRT performance.

       One can force a particular implementation via solr.MMapDirectoryFactory,
       solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

       solr.RAMDirectoryFactory is memory based, not
       persistent, and doesn't work with replication.

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, its a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.

  <!-- To enable dynamic schema REST APIs, use the following for <schemaFactory>:

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified, Solr will load the schema from
       he resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'. 
       
       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
         the never304="true" option)

  <!-- Request Handlers 

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

  <!-- Search Components

       Search components are registered to SolrCore and used by

       By default, the following components are available:
       
       <searchComponent name="query"     class="solr.QueryComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="facet"     class="solr.FacetComponent" />

       <searchComponent name="stats"     class="solr.StatsComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="debug"     class="solr.DebugComponent" />
   
       Default configuration in a requestHandler would look like:

       <arr name="components">
         <str>query</str>
         <str>facet</str>
         <str>mlt</str>

         <str>stats</str>
         <str>debug</str>
       </arr>

       If you register a searchComponent to one of the standard names, 
       that will be used instead of the default.

       To insert components before or after the 'standard' components, use:
    
       <arr name="first-components">
         <str>myFirstComponentName</str>
       </arr>
    
       <arr name="last-components">
         <str>myLastComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
       always be executed after the "last-components"
