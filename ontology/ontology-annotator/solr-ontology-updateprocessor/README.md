# Solr Ontology Update Processor plugin

This directory contains a plugin for enriching records with ontology
annotations by adding further data from the ontology where available.
It is built against Solr 5.0.0, but should work with version 4.x as well.

It should be added to the update chain for the annotated collection,
along with the default update processors. 


## Building the plugin

To build the plugin, navigate to this directory, and execute

```
% mvn clean package
```

This will generate a jar file in the `target` directory containing the OWLAPI
dependencies, skipping those which crossover with Solr. It will be called 
`solr-ontology-update-processor-0.0.1.jar` or similar,
depending on the version number.

**Note**: This plugin now depends on the [Ontology Annotator Core](https://github.com/flaxsearch/BioSolr/tree/master/ontology/ontology-annotator/core)
module, which should be built and installed to your local maven repository 
before building this module.


## Installation

Copy the generated jar file into a directory where Solr can find it, following
the instructions here: [https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPlugins#How_to_Load_Plugins](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPlugins#How_to_Load_Plugins)

In order to use the plugin, you will need to add it to the update request 
processor chain. Define a custom chain by adding the following to solrconfig.xml:

```
  <!-- Ontology lookup processor chain -->    
  <updateRequestProcessorChain name="ontology">
    <processor class="uk.co.flax.biosolr.solr.update.processor.OntologyUpdateProcessorFactory">
      <bool name="enabled">true</bool>
      <str name="annotationField">efo_uri</str>
      
      <!-- Location of the ontology -->
      <str name="ontologyURI">file:///home/mlp/Downloads/efo.owl</str>
      
      <!-- ALTERNATE OPTION - configure OLS for ontology location:
      <str name="olsBaseURL">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/beta/api/ontologies</str>
      <str name="olsOntology">efo</str>
      -->
    </processor>
    <processor class="solr.LogUpdateProcessorFactory" />
    <processor class="solr.DistributedUpdateProcessorFactory" />
    <processor class="solr.RunUpdateProcessorFactory" />
  </updateRequestProcessorChain>
```

This will then need to be added to the update request handler. To add to the
default update request handler, search for the `/update` requestHandler
and modify the following configuration as follows:

```
  <requestHandler name="/update" class="solr.UpdateRequestHandler">
    <!-- Add new updateRequestProcessorChain to update.chain -->
    <lst name="defaults">
      <str name="update.chain">ontology</str>
    </lst>
  </requestHandler>
```

Further details on adding custom request processors can be found on
the [Update Request Processors Solr wiki page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Update+Request+Processors).


## Configuration

There are a number of configuration options available for the plugin. These
are given below, along with their default values where appropriate. The default
values should conform to the default dynamic field naming conventions, so your
schema need not have all the fields defined.

* **enabled** - boolean value to enable/disable the plugin.
Default: `true`.
* **annotationField** *[REQUIRED]* - the field in the input document that
contains the annotation URI. This is used as the reference when looking up
details in the ontology.
* **ontologyURI** *[REQUIRED if using OWL file]* - the location of the 
ontology being referenced. Eg. `http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl` or
`file:///home/mlp/Downloads/efo.owl`.
* **olsBaseURL** *[REQUIRED if using OLS]* - the base URL for OLS lookups.
Eg. `http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/beta/api`.
* **olsOntology** *[only if using OLS]* - the ontology to search for
terms in OLS. Eg. `efo`, `cmpo`. [See below](#additional-configuration-ols)
* **fieldPrefix** - a value to be prepended to all fields created by the
indexer. Defaults to the `annotationField` value, may be set blank.
* **labelField** - the field in your schema that should be used for the
annotation's label(s). Default: `<em>annotationField</em>_label_t`.
* **uriFieldSuffix** - the suffix to use for referenced URI fields, such
as parent or child URI references. Default: `_uri_s`.
* **labelFieldSuffix** - the suffix to use for referenced label fields,
such as the labels for parent or child references. Default: `_labels_t`.
* **childField** - the field to use for child document references. These
are direct (ie. single-step) relationships *down* the hierarchy. This
will be combined with the URI and label field suffixes, so the field names
will be `child_uri_s` and `child_labels_t` (for example).
Default: `annotationField_child`.
* **parentField** - the field to use for parent document references.
These are direct relationships *up* the hierarchy. Field name follows the
same conventions as `childField`, above. Default: `annotationField_parent`.
* **includeIndirect** - (boolean) should indirect parent/child relationships also
be indexed? If this is set to `true`, *all* ancestor and
descendant relationships will also be stored in the index. Default: `true`.
* **descendantsField** - the field to use for the full set of descendant
references. These are indirect relationships *down* the hierarchy. Field
name follows the same conventions as `childField`, above.
Default: `annotationField_descendants`.
* **ancestorsField** - the field to use for the full set of ancestor
references. These are indirect relationships *up* the hierarchy. Field
name follows the same conventions as `childField`, above.
Default: `annotationField_ancestors`.
* **includeRelations** (boolean) - should other relationships between nodes
(eg. "has disease location", "is part of") be indexed. The fields will be named
using the field prefix followed by the relationship type, plus the URI and 
label field suffixes - for example, `annotationField_has_disease_location_uris_s`, 
`annotationField_has_disease_location_labels_t`. Default: `true`.
* **synonymsField** - the field which should be used to store synonyms. If
left empty, synonyms will not be indexed.
Default: `annotationField_synonyms_t`.
* **definitionField** - the field to use to store definitions. If left empty,
definitions will not be indexed.
Default: `annotationField_definition_t`.
* **labelProperties** *[OWL file only]* - the label properties annotation(s). 
There may be multiple definitions of this property. Defaults to the label 
properties value shown [below](#additional-configuration-owl-files).
* **synonymProperties** *[OWL file only]* - the synonym properties 
annotation(s). There may be multiple definitions of this property. 
Defaults to the synonym properties value shown 
[below](#additional-configuration-owl-files).
* **definitionProperties** *[OWL file only]* - the definition properties 
annotation(s). There may be multiple definitions of this property. 
Defaults to the definition properties value shown 
[below](#additional-configuration-owl-files).
* **includeParentPaths** (boolean) - set to true to add a field 
containing all parent paths up to the root node as a multi-valued text 
field. Default: `false`
* **includeParentPathLabels** (boolean) - should the parent paths field
include the labels of the nodes as part of the stored data. Has no
effect if `includeParentPaths` is set to `false`. Default: `false`
* **parentPathsField** - the field to use to store the parent paths.
Default: `parent_paths_t`
* **includeDescendants** - Set to `false` to skip descendant references. Default: `true`
* **includeChildren** - Set to `false` to skip child document references. Default: `true`


### Additional configuration (OWL files)

The plugin attempts to use sensible defaults for the property annotations for 
labels, synonyms and definitions. However, if the ontology being referenced uses
different annotations for these properties, you will need to specify them in
the configuration, using the `labelProperties`, `synonymProperties` and
`definitionProperties` options.

The format is as follows (with the default values given):

```
<str name="labelProperties">http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label</str>
<str name="definitionProperties">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115</str>
<str name="synonymProperties">http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#hasExactSynonym</str>
```

There may be more than one definition for each property. For example:

    <str name="synonymProperties">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/alternative_term</str>
    <str name="synonymProperties">http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#hasExactSynonym</str>

Alternatively, the properties may be comma-delimited:

    <str name="synonymProperties">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/alternative_term,http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#hasExactSynonym</str>

### Additional configuration (OLS)
 
If using the OLS API to retrieve the ontology information, you may optionally
supply the ontology being referenced (via the `olsOntology` configuration
option). This is likely to reduce the time taken to carry out the indexing,
but reduces flexibility - you may not know, or be using multiple ontologies
in a single annotation field.

When an ontology is not specified, the plugin will use the OLS field 
`is_defining_ontology` to attempt to find the best version of a record to use.
If no defining ontology can be found, it will usually default to the first
instance of the record returned by the search for its label, synonym and 
definitions. The parent, child and other relationship fields will be
generated using *all* of the records, which can take a long time and result
in a lot of data being indexed.
